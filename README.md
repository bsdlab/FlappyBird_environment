$ ContinuousFlappyBird: an experimental framework for research on RL in aDBS
================

This repo contains a suite of OpenAI gym-wrapped RL environments, that have similar problem properties than the Parkinson's disease specific aDBS control problem. These environments are
developed based on the FlappyBird implementation provided in the PyGame Learning Environment (PLE) library.


How to for Users
----------------
See the repo FlappyBird_agents/examples for details on how to use the environments.


How to for Developers
---------------------
FlappyBird is adapted to have non-stationary dynamics and a noisy reward.
